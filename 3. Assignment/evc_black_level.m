function [result, asShotNeutral, fnc_read_file_info, fnc_transform_colors] = evc_black_level(input, filename)
% This function is our main function. It executes all functions, that
% were implemented by you, in the correct order.
% ATTENTION: You are not allowed to change this function!

fnc_read_file_info = @(filename) evc_read_file_info(filename);
fnc_transform_colors = @(input, blackLevel) evc_transform_colors(input, blackLevel);

result = evc_transform_colors(input, blackLevel);
end

function [blackLevel, asShotNeutral] = evc_read_file_info(filename)
%evc_read_file_info extracts the black level (blackLevel) and the neutral
% white value (asShotNeutral) from the image file specified by filename.
%
%   INPUT
%   filename... 		filename of the image
%
%   OUTPUT
%   blackLevel... 		black level, which is stored in the image infos
%                       (see imfinfo)
%   asShotNeutral... 	neutral white value, which is stored in the image
%                       infos (see imfinfo)

%TODO:  Implement this function.
%HINT: 	The function 'imfinfo' might be useful.
%NOTE:  The following two lines can be removed. They prevent the
%       framework from crashing.

info = imfinfo(filename);
blackLevel = info.BlackLevel;
asShotNeutral = info.AsShotNeutral;

end

function [result] = evc_transform_colors(input, blackLevel)
%evc_transform_colors adjusts the contrast such that black (blackLevel and
% values below) becomes 0 and white becomes 1.
% The white value of the input image is 65535.
% IMPORTANT: DON'T use the Matlab functions 'rescale' or 'mat2gray' to do
% this!!!
%
%   INPUT
%   input...            input image
%   blackLevel... 		black level of the input image
%
%   OUTPUT
%   result... 			image in double format where all values are
%                       transformed from the interval [blackLevel, 65535]
%                       to [0, 1]. All values below the black level have to
%                       be 0.

%TODO:  Implement this function.
%NOTE:  The following line can be removed. It prevents the framework
%       from crashing.

result = (double(input)-blackLevel)/(65535 - blackLevel);
result(result<0)=0;
