% TODO 2:   Implement this function.
% HINT 1: 	Read the article about Sutherland Hodgman algorithm on Wikipedia.
%           https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland%E2%80%93Hodgman_algorithm
%           Read the tutorial.m for further explanations!
% HINT 2: 	There is an edge between every consecutive vertex in the positions
%       	matrix. Note: also between the last and first entry!

% NOTE:     The following lines can be removed. They prevent the framework
%           from crashing.
