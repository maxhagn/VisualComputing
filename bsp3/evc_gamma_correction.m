function [brightness] = evc_compute_brightness(input)
%evc_compute_brightness calculates the brightness of the input image.
% First the image is normalized by multiplying it with the reciprocal of
% the maximum value of all three color channels. The brightness is then
% retrieved by computing a gray-scale image. Afterwards the result
% is multiplied by the maximum value.

%   INPUT
%   input...        image matrix of dimension: (n, m, 3)

%   OUTPUT
%   brightness...   brightness of the image, matrix of dimension (n, m)

% TODO: Implement this function.
% HINT: The function 'rgb2gray' might be useful.

function [chromaticity] = evc_compute_chromaticity(input, brightness)
%evc_compute_chromaticity calculates the chromaticity of the 'input' image
% using the 'brightness' values. Therefore the color channels of the input
% image are individually divided by the brightness values.

%   INPUT
%   input...            image, dimension (n, m, 3)
%   brightness...       brightness values, dimension (n, m)

%   OUTPUT
%   chromaticity...     chromaticity of the image, dimension (n, m, 3)

% TODO: Implement this function.
% HINT: The function 'repmat' might be useful.
% NOTE: The following line can be removed. It prevents the framework
%       from crashing.

function [corrected] = evc_gamma_correct(input, gamma)
%evc_gamma_correct performs gamma correction on the 'input' image.
% This is done by raising it to the power of the reciprocal value of gamma
% (gamma^-1).

%   INPUT
%   input...        image
%   gamma...        gamma value

%   OUTPUT
%   corrected...    image after gamma correction

% TODO: Implement this function.
% HINT: Make sure the program does not crash because of a division by 0
% NOTE: The following line can be removed. It prevents the framework
%       from crashing.
